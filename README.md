# **1st Semester C++ Labwork**  
### üåü *C++ Programming Journey Through Labs and Robert Lafore's Exercises*  

This repository is a compilation of my **first-semester C++ labwork** and solutions to exercises from *"Object-Oriented Programming in C++"* by **Robert Lafore**.
It offers a mix of practical tasks and chapter-wise solutions, making it a comprehensive resource for learning and revisiting foundational C++ programming concepts.  

The repository has two main sections:  
1. **Labwork Folder**: Contains **9 labs** featuring mixed tasks, exercises, and programs from various topics.  
2. **Robert Lafore Exercises Folder**: Chapter-wise solutions to exercises from the book (excluding Chapters 1 and 8).

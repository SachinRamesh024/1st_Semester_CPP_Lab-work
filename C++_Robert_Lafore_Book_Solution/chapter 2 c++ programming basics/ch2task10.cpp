    /*10. In the heyday of the British empire, Great Britain used a monetary system based on
pounds, shillings, and pence. There were 20 shillings to a pound, and 12 pence to a
shilling. The notation for this old system used the pound sign, �, and two decimal points,
so that, for example, �5.2.8 meant 5 pounds, 2 shillings, and 8 pence. (Pence is the plural
of penny.) The new monetary system, introduced in the 1950s, consists of only pounds
and pence, with 100 pence to a pound (like U.S. dollars and cents). We'll call this new
system decimal pounds. Thus �5.2.8 in the old notation is �5.13 in decimal pounds (actu-
ally �5.1333333). Write a program to convert the old pounds-shillings-pence format to
decimal pounds. An example of the user's interaction with the program would be
Enter pounds: 7
Enter shillings: 17
Enter pence: 9
Decimal pounds = �7.89*/
	float pounds, shillings, pence;
	//1pound=20shillings,1shilling=12pence
	cout<<"Enter pounds:";
	cin>>pounds;
	cout<<"\nEnter shiliings:";
	cin>>shillings;
	cout<<"\nEnter pence:";
	cin>>pence;
	 float dec_pounds=pounds+(shillings+pence/12)/20;
	 cout<<"DECIMAL POUNDS="<<dec_pounds;
